# Apperta guide to working in the open

Apperta believes that [making things open makes them better](https://web.archive.org/web/20140628221103/https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#ninth).

All Apperta supported projects are encouraged to work in the open and share what they're doing whenever they can.

### Request for comment

This document is a **proposal**, and Apperta actively seeks feedback on it via Github Issues and Pull Requests to this repository.

## Code management

Apperta supports many open source projects which it does not itself maintain. 

This document outlines the expectations Apperta has of such projects, and how Apperta will behave with respect to those projects.

The goal of this policy is to respect the autonomy and independence of project originators as much as possible while strongly protecting Apperta's community investment.

In the common case, movement of a GitHub repository involves considerable work, none of which improves the quality of the code, the features of the project, and much of which can actually cause harm to the project.

Furthermore Apperta is in general unlikely to be the sole investor in most open source projects it supports over their lifetime. This would in fact be unsustainable and a risk to the projects and the broader ecosystem. Therefore Apperta **EXPECTS** source code to be managed by whichever person or institution is the maintainer of the proejct.
 
### Responsibilities of maintainers

1. Repositories **SHOULD** remain in the GitHub Organisation of the originator, **UNLESS** the Apperta Technical Subcomittee deem that there is a significant risk of loss of the community's asset through a future closure of the source code, in which case the Apperta Foundation will fork the repository to the Apperta Foundation GitHub organisation.

1. Projects **SHOULD** have demonstrably open source code using a public source code management tool (such as GitHub) 

1. Source code **SHOULD** be up to date with the latest development tip. 

1. Projects **SHOULD** demonstrate a willingness to accept contributions from the community such as Issues and Pull Requests.

1. Live, public internet-facing demonstration instances of the supported apps **SHOULD** be maintained by the originators, under subdomains of the apperta.org top level domain if appropriate.

1. Projects **SHOULD** display the ['Supported By Apperta' badge](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/apperta-image-assets/blob/master/supported_by_apperta_lores.png) on the repositories which have been supported by Apperta, and may demonstrate attribution in other ways if they so wish.

1. Repositories **SHOULD** have a clear copyright notice* stating the copyright owner, and an equally clear [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses).

### Responsibilities of Apperta

1. Apperta **WILL** maintain a simple list or directory of such supported apps and components; their respective subdomain URLs; and appropriate documentation so as to make a demonstration interaction possible.

1. Apperta **MAY** download code snapshots from the originators' repository at the point of completion of a project or at any other time, in order to protect their investment in development of projects.

1. Apperta **MAY** fork a code repository from the originators' repository at the point of completion of a project or at any other time, in order to protect their investment in development of projects.

In exceptional circumstances, variations to this policy may be discussed and agreed by the Apperta Board, for individual projects.
